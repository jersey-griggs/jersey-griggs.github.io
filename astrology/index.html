    <p>Jersey combines traditional and modern astrological techniques to help people better understand themselves. Experience has taught her that the natal chart holds several keys to unlocking a soul’s potential, which lead to a more intentional and fulfilled life. She also specializes in several timing techniques, such as zodiacal releasing, lunar progressions, annual profections, and solar return charts, to help her clients understand their current circumstances, often providing reflective prompts and suggestions on how to navigate their life’s timing.</p>
    <p>Her offerings are varied to reflect a clients needs:</p>

    <h3>Workshops </h3>
    <h4>New Moon Workshop</h4>
    <p>Learning how to work with the moon cycle is one of the most powerful ways to manifest. Every month, the new moon reminds us that we are allowed a fresh breath and a new beginning. As our energy begins to wane, this moon phase is the perfect time for inner reflection and intention setting.</p>
    <p>This 90-minute new moon astrology and yoga workshop will honor the current Zodiac sign through meditation, floor-based stretching, journal prompts, and chart exploration. We will begin with a brief explanation of the current astrological chart, followed by meditation and gentle Yin poses. Participants will then receive journal prompts to help them set intentions prior to the new moon ritual. The workshop will end with  brief yoga nidra to allow participants to fully incorporate the moon’s energetic imprint. This bespoke ritual is based on the full moon’s Zodiac sign and the current astrological landscape, allowing participants to tap into the collective energy.</p>
    <p>Please bring a journal, yoga mat, and writing utensil.</p>
    <h4>Full Moon Workshop</h4>
    <p>Learning how to work with the moon cycle is one of the most powerful ways to manifest. Every month, the Full Moon teaches us to let go. As the peak of the moon cycle, Full Moons illuminate our intentions and ask us to reflect on what we need to release.</p>
