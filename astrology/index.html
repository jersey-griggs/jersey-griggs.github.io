My expertise in timing techniques, including zodiacal releasing, lunar progressions, annual profections, and solar return charts, empowers clients to better understand their current life circumstances. I provide reflective prompts and actionable guidance to navigate life's timing with confidence and clarity.</p>

    <h3>Workshops </h3>
    <h4>New Moon Workshop</h4>
    <p>Working with the moon cycle is one of the most powerful ways to manifest your intentions. Each month, the new moon serves as a reminder of fresh beginnings and the opportunity for renewal. As our energy begins to wane, this lunar phase is the perfect time for introspection and intention setting.</p>
    <p>Join me for a 90-minute New Moon Astrology and Yoga workshop, where we will honor the current Zodiac sign through meditation, floor-based stretching, journal prompts, and chart exploration. The session will begin with a brief overview of the current astrological chart, followed by a calming meditation and gentle Yin yoga poses. Participants will then engage with journal prompts designed to help them set meaningful intentions in preparation for the new moon ritual. We will conclude the workshop with a soothing yoga nidra session, allowing everyone to fully integrate the moon’s energetic imprint.</p>
    <p>This bespoke ritual is tailored to the full moon's Zodiac sign and the current astrological landscape, enabling participants to connect with the collective energy.
    </p>
    <p>Please bring a journal, yoga mat, and writing utensil.</p>
    <h4>Full Moon Workshop</h4>
    <p>Learning to work with the moon cycle is one of the most powerful ways to manifest your intentions. Each month, the Full Moon teaches us the importance of letting go. As the culmination of the moon cycle, Full Moons illuminate our intentions and prompt us to reflect on what we need to release.</p>

The session will begin with a brief overview of the current astrological chart, followed by meditation and gentle movement.

The workshop will conclude with a calming yoga nidra meditation, allowing everyone to fully integrate the moon’s energetic imprint.
