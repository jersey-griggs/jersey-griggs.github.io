## Are you a small business with a mindful mission?

Do you need quality content for your website or blog that will promote your products and attract new customers?

Are you struggling to find the time to:

- *Write that blog?*
- *Compose that email?*
- *Draft that web copy?*

## That’s where I come in.

I’m Jersey Griggs, a freelance copywriter for hire. I work with clients who need blog content, web content, landing pages, email marketing, copy for brochures, and more. 

I specialize in alternative health and wellness and outdoor travel and recreation. I create informative, relevant, and compelling content that captivates your customers and sells your products.

I help you reach your goals so you can help your customers.
