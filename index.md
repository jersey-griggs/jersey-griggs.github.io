Hey there! Thanks for stopping by.

I’m a Maine-based freelance writer and editor with a passion for interesting perspectives and thoughtful words.

I cover wellness, outdoor adventure, travel, and lifestyle topics on digital and print platforms.

My work has been featured in The Discoverer, Travel Trivia, Seeqr, The Sunrise Guide, Herbstalk and Elephant Journal.

I also work with clients in a varied capacity to assist with their writing needs. To learn more, head over to my services page.

If you have a project you’d like to discuss, please **[reach out to me](/#contact)** directly. I look forward to hearing from you!
