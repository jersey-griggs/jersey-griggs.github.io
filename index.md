Hey there! Thanks for stopping by.

I’m a Maine-based freelance writer with a passion for interesting perspectives and thoughtful words.  In my journalism career, I cover wellness, outdoor adventure, travel, and lifestyle topics on digital and print platforms.

I’m a contributor to Business Insider, Newsweek, Condé Nast Traveler, Roadtrippers Magazine, Outside Magazine, The Discoverer, Daily Passport, How to Be a Freelance Blogger, Travel Trivia, Trip Trivia, Outside Bozeman, The Sunrise Guide, Herbstalk, and Elephant JournaI.

I also write creative fiction and poetry, and am currently seeking representation for Dark Summer, the first installment of my Young Adult paranormal mystery series, Widow Lake.

If you’re a literary agent interested in learning more, or you have a writing or editing project you'd like to discuss,  **[reach out to me](/#contact)** directly. I'd love to hear from you!
