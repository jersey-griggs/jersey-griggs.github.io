<h2>Work with Me</h2>

<p>Interested in working with me? Here are the answers to some questions you may have:</p>

<h4>Will outsourcing content affect the brand or vision of my company?</h4>

<p>As a ghostwriter, I am able to adapt to any writing style. My writing will reflect your tone, voice, and brand and I always adhere to a style guide when provided. In the event that I write a guest post for your blog, the writing will have my authorship and will remain true to my voice and style.</p>

<h4>Will you come up with new content ideas for me?</h4>

<p>If you are having difficulty coming up with new content ideas for your blog or email, I’m happy to conceptualize ideas for your choosing. However, this service does come at a higher cost than when you provide the subject matter.</p>

<h4>Will you be able to upload your content to my blog or website or send my marketing emails for me?</h4>

<p>As a writer, I tend to stick to what I do best—writing. So while I am familiar with Wordpress, Markdown, and marketing emails, I prefer to provide my content via Google Doc or Microsoft Word. From there, you or your web developer can upload the content at your own convenience.</p>

<h4>How regularly can you write for me?</h4>

<p>I am available to write on a weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, or quarterly basis. Let me know what you need and we can figure out a schedule that will work for you.</p>
