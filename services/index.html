    <h2>FAQ</h2>

    <h4>Will outsourcing content affect the brand or vision of my company?</h4>

    <p>Not at all. Whether through a phone conversation or thorough research, I’m quickly able to understand my clients' vision and needs. From there, I adapt my writing to reflect the intended voice and tone.</p>

    <h4>What sort of things do you ghostwrite?</h4>

    <p>Books, blogs, bios...you name it, I can do it.</p>

    <h4>Will you come up with new content for my blog?</h4>

    <p>If you are having difficulty coming up with new content for your blog or newsletter, I’m happy to conceptualize ideas for your choosing.</p>

    <h4>Will you be able to upload written content to my blog or website?</h4>

    <p>I am familiar with Wordpress, Markdown, and Ghost. For a slightly higher fee, I will upload content onto your website. Alternatively, I provide content via Google Doc or Microsoft Word. From there, you or your web developer may upload the content at your own convenience.</p>

    <h4>What is your availability?</h4>

    <p>Depending on the scope of the project, I am available to write on a weekly, bi-weekly or monthly basis. Let me know what you need and we can figure out a schedule that will work for you.</p>
