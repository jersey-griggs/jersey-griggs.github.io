## The Good
[The Ikon Pass's](https://www.ikonpass.com/en){:target="_blank"} edge is derived from its sheer numbers. With 5-7 days at 33 destinations, on 3 different continents (Japan, North America, Australia), the Ikon Pass has a lot to offer. In North America alone, its resorts span from New England to the Canadian Rockies, the Southwest to the Northwest. And New Englanders will especially love this pass. The full Ikon Pass offers a collective 21 days at Loon Mountain, Sugarloaf Mountain, and Sunday River, plus 7 at days Sugarbush in Vermont. If you can ski all that and plan a trip out west, the Ikon Pass is a slamming deal.
