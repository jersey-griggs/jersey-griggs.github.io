<p/>Below is a collection of my published work, varying from blog and article posts to web copy for businesses.  Click on the links provided to see the full body of work. Although I specialize in alternative health and wellness and outdoor travel and recreation, I am open to working with new industries. Contact me if you are interested in discussing your project at hand. </p>
