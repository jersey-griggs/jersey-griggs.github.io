  <h2 class="small">Writer. Tarot Reader. Explorer. Lifelong Learner.</h2>
  <hr>
  <section class="tight subsection">
    <p><strong>I’m a writer and a Tarot reader.</strong> I’ve been a writer all my life. From writing short stories as a child to majoring in English, the written word has always been of the utmost importance to me. It’s for this reason I choose to deliver Tarot readings via email. While my work may vary, I love to write pieces that speak to the shared human experience or make way for new life perspectives.</p>
    <p><strong>I’m an explorer, inside and out.</strong> On the outside, I love exploring new places, whether it’s a town I’ve never been to, a mountain summit, or a far flung destination. On the inside, I use Tarot as a tool for self-discovery and guidance, and I love to help others on their own journey.</p>
    <p><strong>I’m a lifelong learner and a total bookworm.</strong> One of the aspects I love most about my work is the learning never ends. When I’m writing, I’m always researching new subjects that inspire me. When I’m reading Tarot, I’m constantly learning more about myself and the human condition. As a naturally curious person, I love researching new topics, diving deep into fascinating subjects, and discovering fresh perspectives about life and the world at large.</p>
