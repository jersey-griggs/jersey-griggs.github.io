<h4>Are you running a small business by yourself? Do you have a long to-do list that keeps you up at night? Do you yearn for...</h4>
<ul>
<li><em>More Time?</em></li>
<li><em>More Energy?</em></li>
<li><em>More Help?</em></li>
</ul>

<h3>That’s where I come in.</h3>

 <p>I’m Jersey Griggs, a freelance copywriter for hire. I’m here to help you get your time back.</p>

I write informative copy that is friendly to search engines, engaging to customers, and beneficial to you.

And I especially love working with cients who have a mindful mission.

Why? Because I believe we all have to give back somehow.

Both my personal and professional life has one consistent theme—helping others. 

After I was a ski bum for a couple of years, I knew I had to start giving back. I worked for years in non-profits, I earned my 200-hour yoga certification and taught yoga, I rescued a dog from an animal shelter, I learned how to garden, and I spent as much time as possible in the outdoors (with my husband and pooch, of course!)

Now, I love to write for people, businesses, and organizations that give back.

I have expertise and knowledge in:
<ul>
<li>Herbalism</li>
<li>Yoga & Ayurveda</li>
<li>Essential Oils</li>
<li>Outdoor Lifestyle & Travel</li>
<li>Sustainable Living</li>
<li>Gardening, Food, & Cooking</li>
<li>Non-Profit Organizations</li>
</ul>

Do you still need convincing?

My knowledge of SEO will rank your business on search engines and my unique writing style will land you more customers and more sales.

I’m also an organized, efficient, and down-to-earth person who completes projects on time.

My extensive experience in administration and operations demonstrates that I know how a business is run. 

I understand the bigger picture. I know that managing me is not on your to-do list—and trust me—you won’t have to.
