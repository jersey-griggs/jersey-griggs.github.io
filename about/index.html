<h2 class="small">Do you often find yourself with a long list of to-dos and not enough time or energy to complete them?</h4>

<h4>I'm here to help</h4>

<p>I’m Jersey Griggs, a freelance copywriter for hire. I’m here to help you get your time back.</p>

<p>I write informative copy that is friendly to search engines, engaging to customers, and beneficial to you.</p>

<p>And I especially love working with cients who have a mindful mission.</p>

<p>Why? Because I believe we all have to give back somehow.</p>

<p>Both my personal and professional life has one consistent theme—helping others. </p>

<p>After I was a ski bum for a couple of years, I knew I had to start giving back. I worked for years in non-profits, I earned my 200-hour yoga certification and taught yoga, I rescued a dog from an animal shelter, I learned how to garden, and I spent as much time as possible in the outdoors (with my husband and pooch, of course!)</p>

<p>Now, I love to write for people, businesses, and organizations that give back.</p>

<p>I have expertise and knowledge in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Herbalism</li>
<li>Yoga & Ayurveda</li>
<li>Essential Oils</li>
<li>Outdoor Lifestyle & Travel</li>
<li>Sustainable Living</li>
<li>Gardening, Food, & Cooking</li>
<li>Non-Profit Organizations</li>
</ul>

<p>Do you still need convincing?</p>

<p>My knowledge of SEO will rank your business on search engines and my unique writing style will land you more customers and more sales.</p>

<p>I’m also an organized, efficient, and down-to-earth person who completes projects on time.</p>

<p>Another big plus—I understand the bigger picture. My extensive experience in administration and operations means that I know how a business is run. I get that managing me is not on your to-do list—and trust me, you won’t have to.</p>
