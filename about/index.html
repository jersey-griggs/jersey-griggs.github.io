  <h2 class="small">Writer. Editor. Thoughtful Creative.</h2>

  <section class="tight subsection">
  <p><strong>Writer</strong>. I’ve been a writer all my life. From writing stories as a child to majoring in English, the written word has always been of the utmost importance to me.</p>
  <p><strong>Editor</strong>. I love to edit. Since my first job as an editor during college, I have always enjoyed using my keen eye to create polished pieces.</p>
  <p><strong>Thoughtful Creative</strong>. I am naturally driven to help people through my work as a wordsmith and a thinker.</p>
  <p>Regardless of the project, I strive to produce quality work that will engage the reader and leave a lasting impression.</p>
  <p>Although I often focus on wellness, outdoor adventure, travel, and lifestyle, I’m always open to different topics and projects. I love to be challenged by writing from unique perspectives and researching new subject matters. I’m also extremely organized and I always meet deadlines.</p>

              <p>When I’m not typing away on my computer, it’s likely I’m off enjoying the great outdoors.  From weekends on the lake at camp (it’s a Maine thing) to skiing and mountain biking with my husband and pup, I use my free time to be in nature. I’m also a certified yoga teacher, an avid home cook, a grower of flowers and vegetables, and a bookworm (as every writer should be).</p>
              <p>If you’re interested in learning more about the work I do, please <strong><a href="/#contact">contact me</a></strong>. I’d love to hear from you.</p>
