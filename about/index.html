  <h2 class="small">Writer. Mindful Explorer. Lifelong Learner.</h2>
  <hr>
  <section class="tight subsection">
    <p><strong>I’m a writer.</strong> I’ve been a writer all my life. From writing short stories as a child to majoring in English, the written word has always been of the utmost importance to me. While my work may vary, I love to write pieces that speak to the shared human experience or make way for new life perspectives.</p>
    <p><strong>I’m a mindful explorer.</strong> I am happiest when I’m going somewhere new, whether it’s climbing a mountain summit, exploring a town I’ve never been to, or traveling to a far flung destination. I also treasure my time at home — hanging with my husband and dog, tending to my garden, reading a book by the fire, or cooking a homemade meal is what fills me up. In this way, I’m an oxymoron — a homebody with an adventurous soul.</p>
    <p><strong>I’m a lifelong learner.</strong> One of the aspects I love most about my work is the learning never ends. When I’m writing, I’m always researching new subjects that inspire me. As a naturally curious person, I love researching new topics, diving deep into fascinating subjects, and discovering fresh perspectives about life and the world at large.</p>
