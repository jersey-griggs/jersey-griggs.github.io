    <h2 class="small">FAQs:</h2>
    <p><strong>What are Tarot cards?</strong></p>
    <p>The Tarot consists of a 78-card deck, each featuring symbolic images that are reflective of the human condition. Every deck is divided between the Major Arcana, which represents the spiritual journey of life, and the Minor Arcana, which speaks to our joys, triumphs, trials, and tribulations. Similar to a deck of playing cards, the Tarot has four suits (Cups, Pentacles, Swords, and Wands) that are indicative of the four elements, and 16 Court Cards, which highlight different personality traits possessed by humans.</p>
    <p><strong>What is an Oracle card?</strong></p>
    <p>Similar to Tarot, Oracle cards contain a message that is helpful for introspection. Unlike Tarot, Oracle cards have fewer rules and each deck varies in its imagery and meaning. As a result, Oracle cards can be used in conjunction with Tarot to further enhance the reading’s message. If you would like a Bonus Oracle card for your reading, you’ll be able to choose from two different deck options, so you can use the imagery that resonates with you the most.</p>
    <p><strong>How does Tarot work?</strong></p>
    <p>Tarot is a mirror. Every time a card is pulled, it reflects back on whatever is going on inside of the querent. Sometimes, we get so caught up in the hubbub of life, it’s difficult to wade through the muck that is blocking our path. We’re often unsure of what to do or we worry about how things will turn out. But Tarot is unaffected by this muck — it clearly reflects our inner wisdom when we need it the most.</p>
    <p><strong>Can Tarot predict the future?</strong></p>
    <p>Since Tarot taps into our intuition, it does not predict the future. However, it does allow us to better see the path before us. Anytime a reading is performed, the card reflects the querent’s current energetic status. According to the law of attraction, you are the creator of your destiny. If you are not happy with the message in your reading, you have the ability to change your course.</p>
    <p><strong>How will I receive my Tarot reading?</strong></p>
    <p>To receive your Tarot reading, fill out the form below. To perform the email reading accurately, I will need a few details about you. These details will not be used for any other purpose and will not be saved after the reading.</p>
    <p>From there, you can ask a question about career, love, or something more general. I also invite you to briefly share any other important information that might be relevant to the situation and your desired outcome. Once you have filled out the form, please send your payment via Venmo to @Jersey-Griggs. I will not perform the reading until the payment has been received.</p>
    <p><strong>Is there anything off-limits in a reading?</strong></p>
    <p>I do not read Tarot for anyone below the age of 18. I also don’t answer questions about health or third parties — I prefer for the question to directly involve the querent’s energy. If a question is out of my ethical boundaries, I will not be able to perform the reading.</p>
    <p><strong>How long does it take to receive my Tarot reading?</strong></p>
    <p>A written PDF and accompanying photo of your Tarot cards will be delivered to the email provided within 48 business hours.</p>
    <p><strong>Can I get a refund if I’m not happy with the message delivered?</strong></p>
    <p>I give my full energy and attention to each reading so they are 100% customized to you. As a result, paid readings are final.</p>
    <p><strong>Any advice about my reading?</strong></p>
    <p>Go in with an open mind. Sometimes, the cards give us a different answer than what we were hoping for. Other times, the message might not resonate immediately and may become more clear as time passes. This is why written Tarot readings are helpful — the answers might reveal themselves with time. Make sure to keep your PDF accessible, so you can refer to it in the future.</p>
    <p><strong>Here are a few testimonials from happy clients:</strong></p>
